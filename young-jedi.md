## [YOUNG JEDI COLLECTIBLE CARD GAME *(YJCCG)*](https://www.starwarsccg.org/young-jedi/)

This was the second card game made by Decipher based exclusively on the events seen in Episode I: The _Phantom Menace._ This game is immense fun and action-packed. The action centers on controlling two of the three main environments seen in the first movie: Tatooine, Coruscant, and Naboo. Like the Star Wars CCG, players make a Light Side or a Dark Side deck (of 60 cards each). Decks based on the Jedi vs. Sith theme as well as the Trade Federation droid army, the heroes of the prequels, and even podracing are all popular! The game is very easy to learn and play, yet has its own unique strategies to master.
