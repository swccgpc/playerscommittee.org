## [JEDI KNIGHTS TRADING CARD GAME *(JKTCG)*](https://www.starwarsccg.org/jedi-knights/)

The third, and final, Star Wars game produced by Decipher, Jedi Knights' intention is to combine the openness of the Star Wars CCG with the action of Young Jedi. The result is a very satisfying card game that is a step up from Young Jedi, but not as complex to learn as the original card game. Only one deck is required of at least 45 cards and may be around a Rebel, Imperial, or Independent theme. The cards themselves are unique in that design was done by a computer graphics artist, giving the player a unique perspective of the Star Wars universe. Jedi Knights is the only one of the three Star Wars games made by Decipher to be multi-player compatible, making games very dynamic and intriguing.
